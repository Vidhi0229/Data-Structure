# Problem Solving using Loops

## Question 1
Given an input array height[] representing the heights of buildings, Write a program to count the number of buildings facing the sunset. It is assumed that the heights of all buildings are distinct.

## Question 2
Given an integer array X[] of size n, write a program to find all the leaders in the array X[]. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
- The last element of an array is a leader by default.
- The largest element of an array is also a leader by default.
- Suppose all the array elements are unique.
- Ordering in the output doesnâ€™t matter.
Example: X[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2], Output:[17, 5, 2]

## Question 3
Given an array X of n integers, write a program to check if the array is a valid mountain array or not. 
Note: The array is a valid mountain when it is first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing.
Example: 
- Input: X[] = [5, 2, 1, 4], Output: false
- Input: X[] = [5, 8, 8], Output: false
- Input: X[] = [1, 2, 6, 5, 3], Output: true
