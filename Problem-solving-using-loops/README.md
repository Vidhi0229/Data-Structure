## Question 2
Given an integer array X[] of size n, write a program to find all the leaders in the array X[]. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
- The last element of an array is a leader by default.
- The largest element of an array is also a leader by default.
- Suppose all the array elements are unique.
- Ordering in the output doesnâ€™t matter.
Example: X[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2], Output:[17, 5, 2]
