# Search

## Question 1
#### Binary Search Algorithm
Given an array X of n integers sorted in ascending order and an integer key, write a program to search for the key in X. If the key exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

## Question 2
Write a program that returns the index of a fixed point in the given sorted array of distinct integers. A fixed point is an index i such that X[i] is equal to i. If a fixed point is found, we should return its index. If no fixed point is found, we should return -1. Note that the integers in the array may be both positive and negative.

Example: Input: X[] = [-4, -2, 0, 1, 4, 6, 7], Output: 4

Explanation: X[4] == 4.

## Question 3
Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, write a program to find the first and last position of a given target value.
- If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
- We must design an algorithm with O(log n) time complexity.
